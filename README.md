# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of my application is to quickly allow users to look for and purchase socks that they love without any added hassle! This means that they should be able to sort our socks by price in case they find some of our selection too expensive and filter by the length of sock they prefer as well as the design/patten they'd enjoy the most on a sock. The value a user has for this website is being able to quickly add items to their cart, increase or decrease the quantity of items, see the total price and check out.

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
